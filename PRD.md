# Product Requirements Document: MCP X Server

## Project Overview

MCP X Server is a comprehensive Model Context Protocol server implementation for X (formerly Twitter) integration. It allows AI assistants like Claude to interface with X's platform capabilities through the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

## Current Features

The current implementation (based on mcp-twitter-server) provides a robust foundation with the following features:

### Tweet Operations
- Post tweets
- Post tweets with media
- Get tweets by ID
- Reply to tweets
- Delete tweets

### User Operations
- Get user information
- Get user timeline
- Follow/unfollow users
- Get followers/following lists

### Engagement
- Like/unlike tweets
- Retweet/undo retweet
- Get users who retweeted
- Get liked tweets

### List Management
- Create lists
- Add/remove users to/from lists
- Get list members
- Get user lists

### Search
- Search tweets
- Search hashtags

## Feature Gaps

Despite the comprehensive feature set, there are three key features missing from the implementation:

1. **Home Timeline**: No ability to retrieve the user's home timeline (feed of tweets from followed accounts)
2. **Poll Support**: No way to create tweets containing polls
3. **Community Features**: No support for X's Communities feature

## Implementation Requirements

### 1. Home Timeline Feature

**Priority**: High  
**Difficulty**: Low  

**Requirements**:
- Create a new endpoint to retrieve the user's home timeline
- Support pagination for larger timeline retrievals
- Allow filtering (exclude replies, retweets, etc.)
- Include proper user and tweet metadata

### 2. Poll Support

**Priority**: Medium  
**Difficulty**: Medium  

**Requirements**:
- Extend tweet creation to support polls
- Allow 2-4 poll options
- Support custom poll duration
- Validate poll parameters

### 3. Community Features

**Priority**: Low  
**Difficulty**: High  

**Requirements**:
- Search communities by keywords
- Join/leave communities
- Get community information
- Post to communities
- Get tweets from communities

## Technical Approach

The implementation should:

1. Maintain the existing architectural patterns
2. Follow the established error handling mechanisms
3. Use consistent parameter validation with Zod
4. Properly document all new API endpoints
5. Include proper TypeScript typing

## Success Criteria

The implementation will be successful when:

1. All three features are fully implemented and working
2. New features follow the existing code patterns
3. All endpoints have proper error handling
4. Documentation is updated to include new features
5. Rate limiting is respected in all new endpoints

## Implementation Timeline

1. **Phase 1**: Home Timeline (1-2 days)
2. **Phase 2**: Poll Support (2-3 days)  
3. **Phase 3**: Community Features (3-4 days)

See the detailed implementation guide in `/docs/implementation.md` for specific code examples and implementation instructions.
