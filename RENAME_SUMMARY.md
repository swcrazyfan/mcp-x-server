# Naming Update Summary

This document summarizes the changes made to update naming from "Twitter" to "X" in user-facing elements of the codebase.

## Changes Made

1. Updated server name in `src/index.ts` from "twitter-mcp-server" to "x-mcp-server"

## Naming Already Using "X"

The following files were already using "X" naming:

1. `package.json`: Package name is "mcp-x-server" with proper description referencing X
2. `README.md`: Title and content already reference "X" instead of "Twitter"
3. `.env.example`: Environment variables use "X_" prefix (X_API_KEY, etc.)

## Intentionally Unchanged

To maintain compatibility for potential pull requests to the original repository, internal code elements were not changed:

1. Code identifiers (variable names, class names, etc.)
2. Import paths or module references 
3. Internal file names (e.g., twitterClient.ts)
4. Type definitions that reference Twitter API objects

This approach ensures user-facing elements display "X" branding while preserving code compatibility.
